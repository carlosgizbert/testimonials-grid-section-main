            "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            where very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It look my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receibing multiple offers. 100%
            recommended!"
